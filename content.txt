Hi there!

If you are looking at my blog, you are either friends and family I chose to share this with, or you're researching ADHD. Or maybe you're just dead bored. 
In any case, I'm glad you're here. This is where I plan to write about my own ADHD journey, and you can definitely expect a lot of chaos and randomness. 
(Chaos and randomness are not the same thing- If you're interested, look up chaos theory!)

I could refine this post and work on my writing, but hey, this is a blog on ADHD. So I'll give you the full experience. Kidding. I'm just being 
lazy. My ADHD brain loved the challenge of learning some html for this website, but working on my writing is... taxing. If you are someone who likes 
an organized, streamlined flow of thoughts and ideas, you are probably going to get real frustrated real soon. 

I created this blog because I am currently procrastinating. I get so many good ideas and project plans when I'm procrastinating. It's amazing. 
What am I supposed to be doing? Grading assignments. A lot of it. And homework that is due tonight. I should probably get back to it.
